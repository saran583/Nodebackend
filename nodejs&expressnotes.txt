Nodejs is an enviroment to run JS outside browsers

// __dirname - path to the current directory
// __filename - file name
// process - info about the env where the program is being executed

Some of the inbuilt Libraries in nodejs - [os, path, fs]

npm init -y creates a node project by taking the default parameters

few packages should be installed as dev dependency because when the application 
is pushed into porduction the exisitng packeage should not cause the trouble 
with the server features

every version of the library installed comes in three decimal points like 15.16.17, 
where the first value(15) means there is huge change in the functionality 
and the second value(16) means there is a patch or minor changes and the 
third value(17) means there is minute change or bug fixes in the library

Promises

when a import function needs to be taken as a promise then we can directly add .promises after the require call
eg: const {readFile} from require("fs).promises;


Events

A EventEmitter consists of two methods that is on and emit where "emit" is used to trigger the data and the
"on" is used as a listener to listen from the emitter

The listener should be declared before the emit because the listener should be listening already to catch the emit

Streams

Streams are used to read/write data sequentially, 
Four types of streams 

    Writable - to write data
    Readable - to read data sequentially
    Duplex - To read and write data
    Transform - to Transform data while reading or writing data


HTTP client

to access different kinds of data there are different kinds of ports for example 
20 -  used for file transfer
80 -  http 
443 - https for http over tls/ssl


When sending a html project with different files we need to create different endpoints for each file
